# What is the "One for All" challenge?

It comes from this 2003 article "[One for All](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/one-all-2003-10-13)" by Mark Rosewater. The rules are:

> 1. "All decks must be exactly sixty cards."
> 2. "All decks may only use one card. That is it must have exactly sixty copies of the same card."
> "The goal is to design as many decks as you can that can beat the control deck. The control deck is made up of sixty-five Maros. The deck needs to be able to win regardless of if it plays or draws."

Maro is essentially a blank card.

> "I was planning on making the deck sixty-five blank cards, but over lunch one day, Aaron Forsythe suggested I make them Maros." -Mark Rosewater

In the original article, Mark Rosewater held a "tournament" of all the cards that could form a winning deck.

# What is this repository?

Since the article is from 2003 I updated it to 2019 with all the cards that didn't exist at the time. There have also been some rules changes (notably the legenday rule change) but in practice this doesn't change anything.

I've tried to be exhaustive, but it's likely that I missed something. If you find anything then [please email me](https://mikepawliuk.ca/contact-me/).
